## 📌 Overview

This project is a fully interactive **ATM Machine Simulation** built using **Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. It demonstrates core banking features such as:

- PIN authentication
- Balance inquiry
- Deposit
- Withdrawal
- Input validation and exit handling

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ PIN-protected account access  
✅ Secure deposit and withdrawal methods  
✅ Prevents overdraws and invalid operations  
✅ Menu-driven interface in CLI  
✅ Clean, reusable OOP structure  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.9+**
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

---

### How to Use in Google Colab:

1. Open your **Google Colab** notebook.

## 🧪 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   https://github.com/Tayyaba-Ramzan/Python-ATM-OOP-Assignment.git


📖 Usage
After running the script, you will see a menu with options:

Copy
Edit
==== ATM Menu ====
1. Check Balance
2. Deposit
3. Withdraw
4. Exit
Check Balance: Displays the current account balance.

Deposit: Adds money to the account (requires PIN verification).

Withdraw: Removes money from the account (requires PIN verification and sufficient balance).

Exit: Terminates the program.

Each operation requires your PIN (default: 1234). Make sure to enter correct and valid input.
